# TinyPasskey
ATTiny85 keyboard emulator for macro key entry. Adapted from : https://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-usb-keyboard/code  
Download the required ATTiny85 library for use in the Arduino IDE, or Atmel Studio : https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Trinket-USB/archive/master.zip  

I made this to simply show how one could use the Atmel ATTiny85 microcontroller to emulate a USB keyboard,  
automatically pressing standard ASCII values used on USB keyboards. An example of this could be for entering  
information such as name, address or passwords.
